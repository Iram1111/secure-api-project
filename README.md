# 🔐 Secure API Project

This is my first Node.js project focusing on **API security**.  
It includes rate-limiting, security headers, and API key authentication.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Rate Limiting** – Protects API from too many requests
- ✅ **Helmet** – Sets secure HTTP headers
- ✅ **API Key Authentication** – Only users with the correct key can access the data
- ✅ **Environment Variables** – API secrets stored securely in a `.env` file
